# Generation Z and the New Economic Reality: A Machine Learning Perspective on Financial Challenges

This repository contains the code and data used in the research study: **"Socioeconomic Disparities Across Generations: A Focus on Generation Z"**. The study explores generational differences in socioeconomic features, such as income distribution and housing affordability, using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict generational membership and year of birth.

## Overview

### Key Highlights:
- **Purpose**: To analyze socioeconomic disparities across generational cohorts, with a focus on Generation Z, and uncover systemic challenges impacting their financial outcomes.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Classification models to predict generational membership.
  - Regression models to estimate the year of birth as a continuous variable.
  - Feature selection using mutual information.
